# FIFA19
## by Rawabi Alharbi


## Dataset

> In this project, I used FIFA 19 dataset, which I imported from Kaggle. FIFA 19 is part of the FIFA series of association football video games. It is one of the most popular games in the world. the dataset contains detailed attributes for every player registered in the latest edition of the FIFA 19 database.


## Summary of Findings

> I started by having a look at the main variables of interest like Age, Weight, and Height to see their distributions. It was interesting to see the age distribution is positively skewed. then, I looked at the relationships between the variables.
> My key findings are:
* Acceleration has a negative correlation with Weight.
* Age has a negative correlation with Potential.
* Wage has a positive correlation with the Release Clause.
* Potential has a positive correlation with the Release Clause.
* Value has a positive correlation with Wage.
> Other than the main variables of interest, I tried to explore the playerâ€™s skillset and I found out that dribbling ability has a strong relationship with finishing ability.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> I looked further into the AGE in order to see what other relationship or influence it has with other variables like Weight, Work rate, Body type as well as Acceleration. I used a Heat map and Facet plot to show these findings. Most of the younger players weigh lesser and their body type is lean. Players with High/High and High/Medium work rates had a high acceleration while the Low/Low have a lower acceleration.
